# A* pathfinder implementation on a map

This repository is an attempt at recreating Google maps and using the A* algorithm to do pathfinding. We will be using OpenStreetMap data about the cities as our graphs. The files are in .graphml format. The current files in this program have Data downloaders and a plotter of the downloaded data.
